# RTL Design Projects

This directory contains RTL design examples developed with a strong emphasis on clarity, modularity, and verification readiness.

---

## Design Focus

- Clean, synthesizable Verilog
- Parameterized modules
- Well-defined interfaces
- Reset and clock correctness

---

## Example Blocks

- ALU and arithmetic units
- Shifter and combinational datapath logic
- Control-oriented RTL components

---

## Engineering Takeaway

RTL is written not just to "work", but to be **easy to verify, debug, and integrate** into larger systems.
