# MSU Hardware & Verification Projects

This repository contains selected graduate-level hardware design and verification projects completed during my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Michigan State University.

The focus is on **RTL design correctness, verification methodology, and practical debug workflows** relevant to ASIC and FPGA development teams.

---

## 🔧 Technical Focus

- **RTL Design:** Verilog/SystemVerilog (ALU, shifter, datapath blocks)
- **Verification:** SystemVerilog, assertions, testbench architecture
- **FPGA:** Design bring-up, simulation-to-hardware consistency
- **VLSI Concepts:** Datapath design, SRAM, hierarchical layout awareness
- **Debug:** Waveform analysis, assertion-driven bug isolation
